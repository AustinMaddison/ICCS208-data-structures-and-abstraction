 \chapter{Task 7: Counting Dashes}

To prove that $f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n)$, such that $c$ and $n$ exist in $\mathbf{I}^+$, and $n \geq n_0$, where $f(n) = n$ and $g(n) = n \log n$:\\

We need to find values for $c$ and $n_0$ such that the inequality holds true.\\

Let's choose $c = 1$ and $n_0 = 1$.\\

For $n \geq 1$, we have: 
\begin{align*}
f(n) &= n \\
g(n) &= n \log n
\end{align*}

Substituting these values into the inequality, we get:
\begin{align*}
n &\leq n \log n
\end{align*}

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we have:
\begin{align*}
\log n &\leq \log(n \log n)
\end{align*}

Using the logarithmic property $\log(a \cdot b) = \log a + \log b$, we can rewrite the right side as:
\begin{align*}
\log(n \log n) &= \log n + \log(\log n)
\end{align*}

Now, the inequality becomes:
\begin{align*}
\log n &\leq \log n + \log(\log n)
\end{align*}

Since $\log n$ is a positive value, we can subtract $\log n$ from both sides, resulting in:
\begin{align*}
0 &\leq \log(\log n)
\end{align*}

For $n \geq 1$, the logarithm of the logarithm of $n$ is always a positive value or zero. Therefore, the inequality $0 \leq \log(\log n)$ holds true.\\

We have shown that for $c = 1$ and $n_0 = 1$, $f(n) = n$ is less than or equal to $c \cdot g(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$.\\
Therefore, we can conclude that $f(n) = n$ is $O(n \log n)$.
