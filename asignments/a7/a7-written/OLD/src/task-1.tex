\small \subsection*{Proof by strong induction.}

\textbf{Proposition}

Every binary tree on n nodes where each has either zero or two children had precisely ${n+1\over2}$ leaves.\\

\textbf{Basis Step:}\

\begin{align*}
    P(1) = {{1+1}\over 2} = 1
\end{align*}

This base case is true because a single node can be considered to have no children thus it the single node is a leaf.\\


\textbf{Inductive Step:}\
(I.H) When P(j) for $1 \leq j \leq k$  then P(k+2) is also true. The constant 2 comes from the proposition that any node can only have 2 or no children thus if we were to want to add more nodes to the tree it must be by 2 nodes at a time.\\

To prove that P(j) is true for $1 \leq j \leq k$ we must consider the invariance caused by the const raint. The binary tree nodes can only have 2 or no children. Suppose binary tree as a state machine starting with a single node n=1. The operation for growing a tree is constrained such that to have more nodes we have to add exactly 2 nodes to a leaf. This in turn also increases the amount of leaves by 1.
